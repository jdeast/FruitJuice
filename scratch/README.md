This plugin allows users to use the scratch programming language to build on a minescraft server.

This source can be (modified and) hosted locally, or you can visit this webpage to access the minecraft/scratch interface.

If the server administrator followed the secure instructions, they can connect from here:

https://jdeast.github.io/FruitJuice/?load_plugin=scratch.js

If they followed the insecure instructions, they can connect here, and must add an exception to this site to "allow insecure content":

https://jdeast.github.io/FruitJuice/?load_plugin=scratch_insecure.js

See ../README_server_setup.md for detailed setup instructions.

Once a server is set up, a vanilla player can connect via scratch or through Minecraft via the WAN connection to the server/port.
